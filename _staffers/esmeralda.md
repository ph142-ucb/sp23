My name is Esmeralda and I am a second year MPH student in Epidemiology/Biostatistics. My research interest are in infectious disease and in mosquito borne diseases such as WNV and Zika. On my spare time I enjoy going to the beach and on hiking trails with my dog! I am looking forward to working with everyone this semester!
