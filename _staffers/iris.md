Hi everyone! My name is Iris and I am a senior studying Public Health and Data Science. I am passionate about public health implications in low-income and unhoused populations, and gender-based violence prevention. In my free time, I love playing basketball, hiking, and seeing my favorite artists at concerts. Feel free to reach out about any issues you may have with Datahub or any other questions. Looking forward to working with everyone this semester!
