My name is Ruben and I am currently a second year in the MPH Epidemiology/Biostatistics program. My research interests are in cardiovascular and chronic disease epidemiology, specifically looking in communities of color. In my free time, I enjoy going on hikes, lounging with friends and sometimes binging a good TV show.
