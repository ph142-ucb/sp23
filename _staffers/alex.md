Hi everyone. My name is Alexander Cabulong, and I am in a joint medical program at the School of Medicine at Case Western Reserve/Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, OH, currently pursuing my MPH in epidemiology on the 11 month track. Prior to matriculation at medical school, I completed my undergraduate work in Classical languages focusing on Latin and ancient Greek literature. In addition to my graduate studies, I am a research fellow at UCSF investigating the effect of atrial fibrillation on stroke and extracranial emboli. Outside of the classroom, I am an avid skier, passionate waterman, and budding culinarian.
