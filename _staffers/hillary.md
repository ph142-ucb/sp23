Hi everyone! My name is Hillary Nguyen, I'm a first-year in the MPH Epidemiology and Biostatistics track. Prior to graduate school, I worked in aging and longetivity research. I'm currently interested in urban environmental epidemiology. In my free time, I'm learning Vietnamese (my heritage language), playing games, and streaming shows.
