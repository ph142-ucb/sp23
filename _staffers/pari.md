Hello! My name is Pari Srivastava, and I am currently a 4+1 MPH Epidemiology/Biostatistics student who hopes to pursue a career in medicine in the future. I hope to explore the intersection of design, technology, and health to make medical services more accessible. During the Master's program, I am looking forward to continuing patient-facing research and developing skills for data collection and analysis. In my free time, you can find me watching sunsets and trying new local restaurants.
