Hi all! I’m Brian and a second year MPH student in Biostatistics / Epidemiology. I’m a Cal undergrad (BS Nutrition) and a former transfer student. My research interests include chronic diseases of aging, and child and maternal health. Although I consider myself an applied researcher, I place value on using techniques such as causal inference in a methodologically sound manner. Outside of class, I enjoy hiking, reading, board and videogames. Looking forward to a great semester with everybody!
